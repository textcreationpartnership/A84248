         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>UPon the 7. of this month, the Lord <hi>Grandi≈øon</hi> advanced from the Kings Army with 3000. hor≈øe and foot, with an
<pb facs="tcp:156290:3"/>intent to march again≈øt the town of <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow</hi> in <hi>Wilt-≈øhire,</hi> but having received a Letter from the L. <hi>Mohune,</hi> concerning the pre≈øent e≈øtate of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> he changed his Re≈øolution, and marched towards the ≈øaid Town, to joyn his Forces with the Lord <hi>Mohune, the Lord Digby, Commi≈ø≈øary Wilmot, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by rea≈øon of his long and tedious <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> night, he lay ≈øhort of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forces about 8. miles, on Thur≈øday morning.</p>
            <p>But towards 12. of the clock the ≈øame day he got to the Lord <hi>Mohune,</hi> where he joyned his Forces with him, and the re≈øt of his Confederates, and about three of the clock in the Afternoon they began to move forward toward <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and about five of the clock they came within one mile of the ≈øaid Town.</p>
            <p>But the Forces that were there billeted having information of their comming, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a Supper for them, and mounted their Ordnance, ≈øetting their men in battle array, and in a very good po≈øture for their

               </gap>rs made their approach neerer the Town, the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Forces began to welcome them, ≈øending them a great Charger full of black plums, which plums were as bad as poy≈øon to tho≈øe that ta≈øted of them; for they made ≈øuch a ≈ølanghter among≈øt the Kings Army, that many hundreds of them lay dead before the Town Walls.</p>
            <p>The Lord Digby and Commi≈ø≈øary Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot ≈øeeing this, with much futy and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they adventured up with their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and gave a de≈øperate charge again≈øt the Parliament-Forces, but did very little exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and although they were fix to one, yet our men gave them the foyl, obtaining a happy Victory, and putting neer upon 9. hundred and fifty to the ≈øword, with the lo≈ø≈øe of one hundred and twenty men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> is dangerou≈øly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, being ≈øhot through the ≈øhoulder with a bullet.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Mohune</hi> and the re≈øt of the Cavaleers are retreated 20. miles from <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and it is very probable hee will have
<pb facs="tcp:156290:4"/>but little ≈øtomack to come thither againe, by rea≈øon they ta≈øted of ≈øuch hard fare; yet if they do come to make another attempt, the plymouth forces are re≈øolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent unto them the like plums which they ta≈øted of before.</p>
            <p>The like proceedings hath bin in <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire,</hi> between the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, again≈øt the well-affected party of that County, as it was declared in a Letter to Sir <hi>William Brewerton,</hi> a member of the Hou≈øe of Commons, intimating that the L. <hi>Rivers</hi> having rai≈øed an Army of Papi≈øts and di≈øaffected prote≈øtants is very active in that County to put in execution the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of Array,</hi> and plunders and pillages all tho≈øe that refu≈øe to yeeld obedience to his illegall Commands.</p>
            <p>And therfore the County de≈øires, that the Parliament will ≈øpeedily take order for ≈øending ≈øome Commanders unto them, for a great part of that County ≈øtands very well affected to the Parliament, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to ≈øpend their lives and fortunes in this cau≈øe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:156290:4"/>
            <p> Whereupon the Parliament have ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that ≈øome ≈øpeedy aid ≈øhall be ≈øent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and that they ≈øhall a≈ø≈øociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues together, to defend them≈øelves from tyranny and oppre≈ø≈øion, and to maintain the peace of that County again≈øt all that did oppo≈øe them.</p>
            <p>And it is credibly informed, that upon Tue≈øday la≈øt there was a generall meeting of the well-affected Prote≈øtants, who ≈øtood in oppo≈øition again≈øt the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> and his Cavaleers, and at the la≈øt gave them a Charge, killing about 40. of his men.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the L. Rivers mu≈øtred his Forces together, placing them in battle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, and drawing them up to a head, and at the la≈øt wheeling about, and obtaining the wind, they charged again≈øt the Parliament Forces, but after one hours fight they were forced to retreat, by rea≈øon that two of our Troops of hor≈øe broke in upon the L. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> left wing, breaking their Rankes and files, and bringing them to a mo≈øt confu≈øed Order, killing 2. or 300, and putting the re≈øt to flight.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:156290:5"/>
            <p> Upon Friday la≈øt, there was Letters came to the Hou≈øe of Commons, directed to Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> out of <hi>Devon≈øhire,</hi> informing the hou≈øe of the true e≈øtate of things in that County, and that the Cavaleers do excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly plunder and ≈øpoyl that County, and that they are marching from <hi>Tave≈øtack</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and do threaten that Town but the Committee for the Militia being there, they have gotten ≈øome new forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town, and are in a good po≈øture of defence.</p>
